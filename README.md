# Introduction

weidulog.com is a quick'n'dirty project to create an online repository for WeiDU logs, where users can easily upload and view other peoples' logs. 

# What is a WeiDU log?

A WeiDU log is a record of mods installed on top of an Infinity Engine game (such as Baldur's Gate II or Planescape: Torment). 

# Why create a repository for them?

When users encounter bugs, mod authors often ask them to provide their WeiDU log to try to pinpoint mod conflicts. weidulog.com was created to help facilitate providing those logs, so they don't have to be posted on the forums, sent via PM, emailed or uploaded to RapidShare etc.
